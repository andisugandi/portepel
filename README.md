# Portepel

Portepel is a simple Django (web) application built to provide simple image gallery as a personal portfolio web site. This web app is built based on awesome tutorial: [Building a Personal Portfolio with Django](https://www.lynda.com/Django-tutorials/Building-Personal-Portfolio-Django/761962-2.html).

## Getting Started

1. Make sure Python 3.x and `venv` module is already installed.

2. Create Python virtual environment and then activate it as shown in [Installing packages using pip and virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) tutorial.

3. Let's suppose your working directory right now is your user home directory, so clone the repository:

        $ cd
        $ git clone https://github.com/andisugandi/portepel.git

4. Change working directory to `portepel`:

        $ cd portepel

5. Install Python modules required, and run the server:

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        $ python manage.py runserver

6. Using a browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and you'll see the application running.
